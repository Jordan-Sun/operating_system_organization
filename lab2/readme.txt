Module Design and Implementation
The module contains three key parts, first is the barrier part, second is the compute part, last is the module exit part.
We design the barrier part by using two atomic variable, one denotes start of barrierï¼ˆstart_guard), and another denotes end of barrier(end_guard).
At the beginning, we initialize the start_guard as the number of threads, and end_guard as zero. So the barrier function first check whether the end_guard is zero, if not, which means this thread is entering the barrier while others is remaining in last barrier. 
So we should spin it to prevent further movement of this thread. After this, we decrement start_guard and test whether it is zero, if so, it should increment the value of barrier_state, a variable measure how many time those threads pass the barrier, otherwise, 
this thread will spin itself until the last thread enter the barrier and decrement the start_guard to zero. 
Each thread passing the spin section will increment end_guard, and only one thread will end up testing the value of end_guard the same as number of threads. And that thread will reset both start_guard and end_guard. And then it will record the time depending on 
the value of barrier_state.
