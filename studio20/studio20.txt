trace-cmd

That cpu just keep switch between those process and execution of my program.

4.
The largest priority we can use in sudo is 99.
And we cannot change scheduler without sudo.


5.
Basicly speaking, nearly no processes preempted my program, but one at the beginning,
whose name is thd.


6.
Only 4 times switches on cpu 0.
And 2038 times switches on cpu 1.
And 5954 times switches on cpu 2.
And 1779 times switches on cpu 3.


7.
Only two number of priority have been used, first is 99, second is 50.

rcu_preempt
migration
watchdogd
irq

maybe those processes need to be change dynamically the priority number.

8.
5 switches.
My program is never preempted.

9.
The time slice of round-robin is 0.1s.

The pattern I see is that three process evenly preempt the cpu for computing.
Its like a periodic sequence that shows three different color blocks meaning
three different execution to take cpu.
